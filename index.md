# Heart Aches
There is an ache that never leaves me—a yearning for something just out of reach. It feels constant, as though I am always chasing shadows, trying to fill a void I can’t quite name. Every glance at my phone stirs that ache: a wish to look like someone else, to live their life, or to hold close a person who seems forever out of my grasp.
When I first realized I had feelings for a woman, my world turned upside down. People had hinted before, as if they saw something in me I couldn’t admit to myself. But the truth is undeniable now: I’ve been in love with the same girl for six years. I watch her life through a screen, cherishing fleeting online interactions. Her smile, her laugh, the way she carries herself—everything about her feels extraordinary. Yet, it breaks me to see her give her heart to those who can’t see her radiance. My heart aches for someone who no longer occupies my life, and perhaps never will.

Over the years, I’ve had many friends who blurred the lines between platonic and something more. Flirtations and touches that left me questioning their intent. But none of them compare to the golden goddess who haunts me. I’ve written countless poems about her, yet I wonder how she would react if she knew. The only other person who stirred a similar confusion is my best friend. Ironically, they’ve confided in me about feeling the same way. They’ve been my light in the darkness, my constant companion through life’s storms. Yet, our connection has always ebbed and flowed. When they entered a long-term relationship, it felt like I was being pushed to the periphery, discarded like an afterthought. But when that relationship ended, they returned to me, holding on as though I might vanish.

It’s strange how others seem to see possibilities in us that I’ve never considered. A friend once joked that we’d end up together, and it confused me more than anything. And it made me wonder—do they see something I don't? Something I could never see? I've never truly felt anything for them in a romantic sense, but it did confuse me to see how other people saw us from the outside. I could never ask them about this, because I worry they'll assume something that it isn't true. A misunderstanding that I would much rather avoid. 

And maybe that’s the crux of it all: this endless yearning. Not for my best friend, specifically, but for everything. I yearn to be more—to look like others, to live a life that feels vibrant and meaningful, to excel in ways that make me proud. Yet, I find myself trapped in comparison, spiraling in thoughts of mediocrity. It’s exhausting, the way my mind works against me.

Recently, I faced the possibility of delaying my academic journey—a result of my own procrastination. The scare was enough to jolt me awake, reminding me that my dreams are fragile, dependent on my actions. It’s not enough to plan a life on Pinterest boards; I have to make it real. And yet, that ache remains—a reminder of all I long for and all I’m afraid to lose.

Perhaps that’s the beauty of it: the ache, the yearning, the imperfect striving.
